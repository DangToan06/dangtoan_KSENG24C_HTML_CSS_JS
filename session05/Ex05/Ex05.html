    <h1>5. Groups of selectors</h1>
    <p>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual
        selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same
        declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the
        comma.</p>
    <section>
        <p>CSS example:</p>
        <p>In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus, <br>h1 { forn-family:
            sans-serif } <br> h2 { forn-family: sans-serif } <br>h2 { forn-family: sans-serif  }</p>
        <p>is equivalent to:</p>
        <p>h1, h2, h3 { forn-family: sans-serif }</p>
